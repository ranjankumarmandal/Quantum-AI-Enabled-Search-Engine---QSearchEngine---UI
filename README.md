# Quantum AI Enabled Search Engine

# Custom Search Engine – UI Prototype

This project is the **frontend (UI) prototype** for the our Quantum AI Enabled Search Engine Project.

It provides an intuitive web interface for **querying, visualizing, and interacting** with the search results served by the backend APIs like other popular classical search engine (Eg. Google, Microsoft Bing, etc.) with the power of Quantum AI.

The research is to deliver a seamless user experience that complements the backend’s capabilities, with a modern and responsive interface ready for future integration and to build a foundation similar to a classical search engine, ready for future integration with **LLM** and **Quantum-AI-based** modules.

## About API Consumption
